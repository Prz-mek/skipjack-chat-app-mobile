## Introduction
The system enables real-time communication. The program allows user to create group
conversations and add contacts and to send messages in private and public chat conversations.
It also provides an authentication and a user interface in two languages. The system was made in
a two-tier architecture and consists of a [server](https://github.com/Prz-mek/skipjack-chat-app-backend) and a mobile application. The user interface was
designed according to Atomic Design methodology.

The platform was implemented in TypeScript. The server application uses Node.js with the
Express.js framework. The mobile application was created with React Native. The system uses the
non-relational database MongoDB for data storage.
